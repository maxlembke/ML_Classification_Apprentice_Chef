# ML_Classification_Apprentice_Chef
This repo is based on a business case elaborated for the Machine Learning course at Hult International Business School by the professor Chase Kusterer.

## Files & Task
The project consistet of three distinct tasks: 

### 1) Regression Model Development
I was tasked with using the information in our course case to build a predictive model on a continuous response variable (Y-variable). This assignment encompasses feature engineering, model preparation, variable selection, and model development.

### 2) Classification Model Development 
I was tasked with using the information in our course case to build a predictive model on a binary response variable (Y-variable). This assignment encompasses feature engineering, model preparation, variable selection, and model development.

### 3) Unsupervised Analysis Project (with Team) 
Our team was tasked to analyze and interpret an unsupervised learning problem based on survey data. This required an ability to code unsupervised machine learning algorithms and interpret their results.

## Additional Information
~~~
The business case is based on Apprentice Chef, Inc. - a fictitious meal kit delivery company.

Apprentice Chef, Inc. is an innovative company with a unique spin on cooking at home.
Developed for the busy professional that has little to no skills in the kitchen, they offer a wide
selection of daily-prepared gourmet meals delivered directly to your door. Each meal set takes at
most 30 minutes to finish cooking at home and also comes with Apprentice Chef's award-winning
disposable cookware (i.e. pots, pans, baking trays, and utensils), allowing for fast and easy
cleanup. Ordering meals is very easy given their user-friendly online platform and mobile app.
